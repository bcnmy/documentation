## Key Features


### Single Dapp Session Key Pattern
- Uses a single session key owned by the dapp for all users
- Users grant limited trading permissions to this trusted dapp key
- No need for database or key management infrastructure
- Highly secure as only one private key needs to be protected
- Permissions are strictly limited to swapping a specific number of tokens

### Benefits of this Pattern:
- **Simplified Key Management**: Dapp maintains just one session key
- **Reduced Infrastructure**: No need to store or manage multiple user keys
- **Enhanced Security**: Single point of security for the dapp's session key
- **Scalable**: Can handle unlimited users with the same session key
- **Limited Scope**: Each user's permission grant is strictly bounded to specific action on a specific contract

### Universal Action Policy
Restricts which smart contract functions can be called and with what parameters:
- Whitelisted contract addresses only
- Specific function calls (e.g., mint functions)
- Maximum transaction amounts
- Parameter validation for each action

### Time Constraints
Time Range Policy ensures security through time-bound sessions:
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Automatic deactivation after expiry
- Requires new session creation for continued access

## How It Works

1. When you connect your wallet, the app creates a new session with specific validation policies and action permissions.

2. Each session is configured with:
   - Whitelisted contract addresses
   - Specific function selectors for minting
   - Maximum transaction limits
   - Time-based constraints

3. The session key remains in the dapp's custody while allowing execution within the defined boundaries.

4. All transactions are fully on-chain and verifiable through your smart account.

## Gas Sponsorship

This app uses Biconomy's Paymaster to sponsor gas fees for users, making the experience completely gasless:
- Covers all gas costs for automated actions
- Maintains a gas tank for transaction sponsorship
- Implements configurable spending limits and rules
- Provides real-time monitoring and notifications

## Technical Implementation

The demo app is built using:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Biconomy SDK for Smart Account and Smart Sessions
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui for UI components

## Try It Yourself

1. Connect your wallet
2. Create a session key with custom permissions
3. Use the session key to swap tokens on a DEX
4. Observe gas savings and improved UX with permissions

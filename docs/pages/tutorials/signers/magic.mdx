## How to use Magic signer with Biconomy smart accounts

[Magic](https://magic.link/) makes it easy to authenticate users and integrate them into your Web3 dApps quickly.
By integrating Magic with the Biconomy SDK, you can pair Magicâ€™s seamless social login experience with smart wallets powered by Nexus accounts. This enables features like gas sponsorship, transaction batching, and more, ensuring a frictionless experience for your users.

## Integration

::::steps

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm i @magic-ext/oauth magic-sdk @biconomy/sdk viem
```

### Create the `Magic object`
After following the Magic documentation, you will have access to a MagicBase object as shown below that you can pass as an owner to createeSmartAccountClient:

```typescript 
import { OAuthExtension } from "@magic-ext/oauth"
import { Magic as MagicBase } from "magic-sdk"
 
const magic = new MagicBase(process.env.MAGIC_API_KEY as string, {
	network: {
		rpcUrl: "https://sepolia.base.org",
		chainId: 84532,
	},
	extensions: [new OAuthExtension()],
})
 
// Get the Provider from Magic and convert it to a smartAccountOwner
const smartAccountOwner = await magic.wallet.getProvider()

```

### Create the Biconomy client

Next, use the Magic account to initialize the Biconomy Nexus Client:

```typescript
import { OAuthExtension } from "@magic-ext/oauth"
import { Magic as MagicBase } from "magic-sdk"
import { createNexusClient, NexusClient } from "@biconomy/sdk"; 
import { baseSepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { http } from "viem";

const main = async () => {
    const bundlerUrl = `https://bundler.biconomy.io/api/v3/84532/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44`

    const nexusClient: NexusClient = await createNexusClient({
        chain: baseSepolia,
        signer: smartAccountOwner,
        transport: http("https://sepolia.base.org"),
        bundlerTransport: http(bundlerUrl),
    })

}

main();

```

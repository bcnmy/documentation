# Understanding MultichainContract

The `MultichainContract` is a powerful abstraction in the MEE SDK that lets you interact with the same contract across multiple chains using a single, unified interface. Think of it as a "master remote control" that can operate the same contract regardless of which chain it's deployed on.

## Creating a MultichainContract

Here's how you create one:

```typescript
const mcUSDC = getMultichainContract({
    abi: erc20Abi,
    deployments: [
        ["0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85", optimism.id],
        ["0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913", base.id],
    ],
});
```

This creates a contract instance that knows about USDC on both Optimism and Base chains.

## Reading From Multiple Chains

One of the most powerful features is the ability to read from multiple chains in a single call:

```typescript
// Read USDC balances across multiple chains
const balances = await mcUSDC.read({
    account: mcNexus,
    functionName: "balanceOf",
    args: [accountAddress],
    onChains: [optimism, base],
});

// balances will be an array of:
// [
//   { chainId: optimism.id, result: 1000000n },
//   { chainId: base.id, result: 2000000n }
// ]
```

Instead of making separate RPC calls and handling responses for each chain, you get all the data in one clean operation.

## Encoding Chain-Specific Actions

When you need to create transactions, the `.on(chainId)` method lets you specify which chain you're targeting:

```typescript
// Create a transfer operation on Optimism
const transferOp = mcUSDC.on(optimism.id).transfer({
    args: [recipientAddress, parseUnits("100", 6)],
    gasLimit: 100000n
});

// Create an approval operation on Base
const approvalOp = mcUSDC.on(base.id).approve({
    args: [spenderAddress, parseUnits("1000", 6)],
    gasLimit: 100000n
});
```

Each operation is automatically encoded with the correct contract address for that specific chain. The SDK handles all the details of proper encoding and chain-specific parameters.

## Type Safety

The `MultichainContract` is fully typed - you get autocomplete for:
- Contract functions available in your ABI
- Function arguments with proper types
- Return types from read operations

If you try to call a function that doesn't exist in the ABI or pass incorrect arguments, you'll get a TypeScript error at compile time.

## Common Use Cases

The `MultichainContract` excels at scenarios like:
- Checking balances across multiple chains before initiating a transfer
- Creating complex multi-chain operations where you need to interact with the same contract on different chains
- Building interfaces that need to show data from multiple chains simultaneously
- Encoding chain-specific transactions as part of larger multi-chain workflows

The beauty of this abstraction is that it handles all the complexity of cross-chain contract interactions while presenting a clean, unified interface for your code.

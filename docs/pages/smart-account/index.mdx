# NexusSmartAccount

The `NexusSmartAccount` class is a comprehensive implementation of a smart contract account that is compliant with ERC-7579 and ERC-4337 standards. It is part of the Biconomy suite of contracts for Modular Smart Accounts.

## Overview

`NexusSmartAccount` extends `BaseSmartContractAccount` and provides a wide range of functionality for managing and interacting with smart contract accounts. It includes features such as:

- Account creation and deployment
- Transaction execution
- User operation building and sending
- Module management (installation, uninstallation, and querying)
- Balance checking
- Gas estimation
- Signature validation

## Key Components

### Modules

The account supports various types of modules:

- Validation modules
- Execution modules
- Fallback modules
- Hook modules

These modules can be installed, uninstalled, and queried, allowing for a flexible and extensible account structure.

### Bundler and Paymaster

The class integrates with a bundler for submitting user operations and a paymaster for gas abstraction, enhancing the user experience by potentially allowing gasless transactions.

### User Operations

The class provides methods for building, signing, and sending user operations, which are the core concept of ERC-4337 for account abstraction.

## Main Methods

Some of the key methods include:

- `create`: Static method to create a new NexusSmartAccount instance
- `getAddress`: Retrieves the account's address
- `sendTransaction`: Sends a transaction (or batch of transactions)
- `buildUserOp`: Builds a user operation
- `sendUserOp`: Sends a user operation
- `installModule`: Installs a module on the account
- `uninstallModule`: Uninstalls a module from the account
- `getBalances`: Retrieves token balances for the account
- `signMessage`: Signs a message using the account

## Usage

The `NexusSmartAccount` is designed to be used as part of a larger system for managing smart contract accounts. It provides a high level of flexibility and functionality, allowing developers to create sophisticated account-based applications.

To use this class, you would typically:

1. Create an instance using the static `create` method
2. Use the instance to perform actions like sending transactions, managing modules, or interacting with the blockchain

## Advanced Features

The class also includes advanced features such as:

- Counterfactual address calculation
- ERC-6492 compliant signature generation
- Gas estimation for user operations
- Token fee estimation and management
- Support for various execution modes

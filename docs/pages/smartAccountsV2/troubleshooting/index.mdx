# TroubleShooting

If youâ€™re having trouble executing transactions, try the following troubleshooting steps:

- Verify that you are using the correct Bundler URL, Paymaster ID, and Chain ID. 
- Ensure that you are passing the paid rpc url in the [createSmartAccountClient](/smartAccountsV2/account/methods#createsmartaccountclient) method.
- For gasless transactions, confirm that there are sufficient funds in the Paymaster. Additionally, make sure the SPONSORED flag is set in the [sendTransaction](/smartAccountsV2/tutorials/sendGasless/#step-3-send-the-transaction-and-wait-for-the-transaction-hash) function.
- If you are transferring tokens from a smart account, ensure that the tokens are held within the smart account, not the EOA. For more examples, visit the [SDK-examples](https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples) repository.
